# Imap-Transfer-Python (IMAP TOOLS)

Imap-Transfer-Python is a script that enables you to move IMAP inboxes between two mail servers easily. üì®üì•

## Transfer Features
* Moves emails from source inboxes to specific destination inboxes, providing full control to the user. 
* Option to use "auto-mode" for automatic identification of source and destination folders. üîÑ
* Ensures that duplicate emails are not transferred, preventing duplication if a disconnection occurs during the transfer. 
* Retains email flags
* Supports both SSL and TLS connections, ensuring secure email transfers. üîí

## Backup Features
* Allows backing up emails locally to password encrypted ZIP file
* Creates a backup of the emails by fetching all message IDs from the source mailbox and storing them in the backup file.

## Restore Features
* Allows restoring emails from a backup file.
* Ensures that duplicate emails are not restored, preventing duplication if a disconnection occurs during the restore process.

This script has been used and tested with over 100 different mailboxes varying from size 200mb to 100GB. The speed of transfer depends on your connection and the mailservices connection.
